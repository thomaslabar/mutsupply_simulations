# Mutation Supply Simulations

This project contains scripts to explore hypotheses concerning the role of population size in altering
the genetic architecture of evolutonary repair in asexual populations.

## Description

This project contains code to simulate the evolution of asexual populations adapting to a 
novel environment with an exponential distribution of beneficial fitness effects. It was designed
to simulate an evolutionary repair experiment (cells adapting in response to a genetic perturbation) 
with two population size treatments.
